# Acknowledgments

## Development

This project was developed with the assistance of **Claude Sonnet 4.5 (Preview)** by Anthropic, serving as an AI development agent throughout the entire project lifecycle.

### AI-Assisted Development

The AI agent contributed to:

- **Architecture & Design**: Guidance on header-only library design patterns and modern C++23 best practices
- **Implementation**: Code structure, error handling strategies, and JSON-RPC 2.0 specification compliance
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit test suite design (31 tests) and real-world example implementations
- **Documentation**: Creation of extensive tutorials (JSON.md, JSONRPC2.md), API documentation (README.md), and quick reference guides
- **Build System**: Custom C++ build system implementation (builder.cpp)
- **Project Management**: Code organization, git workflow, and repository setup

### Human Oversight

All code, design decisions, and implementations were reviewed, validated, and approved by the project maintainer. The final architecture, code quality, and project direction reflect human judgment and expertise.

### Transparency

This acknowledgment is provided in the spirit of transparency about the tools and processes used in modern software development. AI assistance was used as a productivity tool, similar to IDEs, linters, and other development aids.
