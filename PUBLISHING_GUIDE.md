Title: [Article] Building a Modern C++23 JSON-RPC 2.0 Library

Body:
I recently completed a header-only C++23 library implementing the JSON-RPC 2.0
specification and wrote about the journey.

The article covers:
- Design decisions (why header-only, why C++23)
- Implementation highlights (dispatcher pattern, error handling)
- Real-world examples with code
- Testing approach (31 unit tests)
- Lessons learned

The library and all code are open source on GitHub.

I'd love to hear your feedback on both the implementation and the article!
